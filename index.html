        <h2>Heceta Lighthouse Bed & Breakfast <br> Heceta Beach, Oregon <br> August 3, 2024</h2>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Welcome!</h2>
            We’re excited to have everyone come celebrate the wedding of Kristen and LJ! The wedding ceremony will be held Saturday August 3rd, 2024 at 4:30pm with guests arriving at 3:00pm at the Heceta Lighthouse Bed & Breakfast at Heceta Beach, Oregon. <br><br>NOTE: all invited guests are welcome to bring a plus one to share in the joyous occasion. <br> Also we welcome guests to bring their young children, we just ask that during the ceremony, if they are making any noise to please bring them into the lightkeeper's house as we don't want any distractions for those few moments.

            <h2>Travel</h2>
            For folks traveling from out of state the best two options for airports are Portland Intl Airport and Eugene’s Regional Airport. PDX will likely be the move for those coming from the east coast however west coast based friends might be able to find comparable flights to Eugene which will allow for a much shorter drive to the coast. (~1 hr drive from Eugene, ~3 hrs from Portland).
            </section>

            <h2>Accomodations</h2>
            The families will be staying at the Lighthouse Keeper’s B&B and in the nearest town of Yachats 20 minutes to the north. Accommodations in several price ranges exist in Yachats with our host’s recommending the overleaf hotel and driftwood inns though a number of vacation rental/airbnb/vrbo’s are available as well. Florence, 20 minutes south of the lighthouse, also has a variety of hotels and vacation rentals available including the Driftwood Shores Resort, Best Western Pier Point Inn, and the River House Inn.</p>

            <h2>Local Transportation / Shuttles</h2>
            Heceta Beach is a uniquely secluded state park. The day parking lot has a short path that leads to the venue for guests planning on driving themselves to the ceremony, we will also be providing statepark parking passes for these folks, just message LJ, there should be plenty of parking and they are only $5 if you can't get ahold of him. <br> <br> To allow our guests to drink and enjoy themselves we will be providing a free private shuttle service that will run from several locations in both Yachats and Florence. The shuttle will provide pickups before the ceremony with both early and late return trips mid evening and at the end of the night. Those who got back to LJ about their accommodations will be picked up from their accomdations, pending room in the vans, all others can get picked up from the downtown locations to be provided.

            <h2>Attire</h2>
            Cocktail Attire. Come get fancy with us! Your snazziest suit & tie, formal separates, dressy jumpsuits, cocktail, mid and floor-length dresses are all welcome. Please no jeans or t-shirts but its an outdoor wedding so you can leave the tux at home too! While Oregon is hot in August, the coast is reliably 20 degrees cooler than inland often with a cool breeze off the ocean so keep in mind the evening may get chilly with nighttime lows reliably around 50'.
